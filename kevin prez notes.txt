-- la_condenser.py

::Huge file size (>gig each, 25+col, many years), trim down to few categories

*First we take original crime data file (25+ columns, 2010-2018)
   *columns include: victim info (demog.), multiple crime categories, address, etc.

*Filter years to 2015-17

*Keep only 6 columns (of relative importance)


-- LA_Cleanup_Kevin.ipynb

::This is the code I used to clean the LA data (crime types)

*Load the moderately-cleaned CSV

*Further narrow down to 3 columns

*Load LUT for crime types

*Merge, add Year column

*Save that to new CSV


-- LA_Weather_1_Kevin.ipynb

::Focus on Pivot

*Load raw weather data (column labels in Excel, fillna "Clear")
  *(and also crime CSV we just exported)

*Group Crime by date and (broad) category, pivot

*Reformat date stamp w/ pd.to_datetime (shown with Weather)

*(same for Chicago, including crime cleanup)

*Now condense weather to Date, Temp, Event

*Create "Total" column for crime

*Merge the two (shown for Chicago)
